Problem Statement:
Over-specialization of movies based on user behavior pattern/preferences and parallel content , however, can lead to situation of being in a ‘filter bubble’ which means of MovieLens will give recommendation of movies already consumed by user and it would restrict from understanding other’s choices and tastes. This implicit information is also difficult to obtain. Users are also interested in watching top 10, popular or trending movies when released on platforms like Netflix or Amazon prime even if the profile (personality) is created in a way. Also, failing in providing in accurate recommendation can lead to dissatisfaction.

Collaborative filtering is great technique based on the concept of neighborhood and does not need an ‘understanding’ of the user personality. Thus, I am more interested in collaborative filtering for building recommender systems.

I will be looking at creating an ALS model for collaborative filtering.
